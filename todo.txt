Problem:
Planner is slow
Motion primitives are too long (so trajectory looks wobbly) - would like to make them shorter, but this would slow down runtime even more


Possible solutions:
Implement ARA*
Plan in grid space, then fit splines
Snap nodes to grid


Set constant the weight of the potential cost function relative to the path length?

Change the weight of path length in the heuristic.
