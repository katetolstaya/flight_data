TODO

Tune velocities and tolerances
Add time constraints
Take-offs

---------------------------------------------------

New ideas:

1) Prune high cost trajectories (as if high cost regions are fake obstacles)
3) Refine splines by adding control points sampled using a Variational Autoencoder ( won't generalize to landing vs takeoff)
