Problem:
Planner is slow
Motion primitives are too long (so trajectory looks wobbly) - would like to make them shorter, but this would slow down runtime even more


Possible solutions:
Implement ARA*
Plan in grid space, then fit splines
Snap nodes to grid


Set constant the weight of the potential cost function relative to the path length?

Change the weight of path length in the heuristic.


IDEAS:

1) Prune high cost trajectories (as if high cost regions are fake obstacles)
2) Interpolate resulting trajectories using splines
3) Refine splines by adding control points sampled using a Variational Autoencoder




---------------------------------------------------

1) Why does the delta_z seem to vary?
2) tuning velocities, goal tolerances
3) spline interpolation of the actual function

4) COST MAP
